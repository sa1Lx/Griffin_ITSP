# Project Description

We are developing a bipedal robot that has the ability to walk, integrated with a quadcopter model which allows it to hover low altitudes. We aim for making a basic prototype and then make advances to improve the ranges of output as will be declared in futurePlans.md.

# Project Structure

We have divided the project into two main parts:
1. **Bipedal Robot**: This part of the project focuses on the design and implementation of a bipedal robot that can walk.  
2. **Quadcopter**: This part of the project focuses on the design, implementation and integration of a quadcopter that can hover at low altitudes.
