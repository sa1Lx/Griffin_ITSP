This is the file containing details on the electronics of the Bipedal Model.

The components are listed under [Components](components.md).

Overview of Key Components:
    1. 11.1 V Battery: provide 11.1 V ouput Voltage via Amass Nylon T charge port, then we connect it using the male connector, use 14 AWG wire to connect it with Step-Down Power Supply Module  
    2. XL4016E1: adjust and check with multimeter to provie stable 5V supply, might debate to purchase a heatsink  
    3. Arduino Uno: 5V supply with 5V pin and GND, and connect servo motors signal line using jumper wires  
    4. Servos: connect with 5V supply from XL4016E1
